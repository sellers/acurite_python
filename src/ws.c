    Experimentation with a USB interface to the Acu-Rite 5 in 1 Weatherstation
    specifically for the Raspberry Pi.  The code may work on other systems, but I 
    don't have one of those.  Contrary to other folk's thinking, I don't care if 
    this ever runs on a Windows PC or an Apple anything.
    
    I specifically used a model 2032 display with the sensor that I picked
    up at one of those warehouse stores.  The display has a usb plug on it and 
    I thought it might be possible to read the usb port and massage the data myself.
    
    This code represents the result of that effort.
    
    I gathered ideas from all over the web.  I use the latest (for this second)
    libusb and about a thousand examples of various things that other people have 
    done and posted about.  Frankly, I simply can't remember all of them, so please,
    don't be offended if you see your ideas somewhere in here and it isn't attributed.
    
    I simply lost track of where I found what.
    
    This module relies on libusb version 1.0.19 which, at this time, can only be
    compiled from source on the raspberry pi.
    
    Because there likely to be a version of libusb and the associated header file
    on a Pi, use the command line below to build it since the build of libusb-1.0.19
    places things in /usr/local
    
    cc -o weatherstation  weatherstation.c -L/usr/local/lib -lusb-1.0    
    use ldd weatherstation to check which libraries are linked in.
    If you still have trouble with compilation, remember that cc has a -v
    parameter that can help you unwind what is happening.
